"1","Elsys - ERS Eco CO2","ElsysImage","The ERS Eco CO2 can last up to 30 days in the dark depending on the sample interval, transmit interval, data rate, and environmental factors. It can be used with a self-adapting feature that will result in lower current consumption, lower network load, and less redundant data sent. With the feature activated, the sensor will adapt the transmission rate if the measured data is unchanged.","300","Elsys"

"4","Sensative Strips","SensativeImage","Strips Presence for LoRaWAN is an innovative ultra-thin (3mm) active IR occupancy sensor for smart offices and buildings. Strips presence monitors the desk occupancy rate by measuring objects and people within close range (configurable up to 50 cm). It can be mounted invisibly or highly discreetly and is very suitable for office applications such as hot-desking and similar services.

Strips Presence can also be used for asset monitoring such as paintings and other valuables. You also have the possibility to use the included magnetic sensor to monitor open/close of doors, windows, or drawers.","80","Sensative"
"5","Watteco Bob Assistant","WattecoImage","BoB Assistant is a LoRaWAN low power compatible vibration sensor perfect for indoor and outdoor predictive maintenance of industrial applications. It is combined with a temperature sensor made for environmental conditions, an RGB Led for the User Interface and a push-button.

BoB Assistant measures and evaluates vibrations to identify irregular behaviors in industrial machines, it possesses an artificial intelligence capable of finding anomalies before a failure takes place. This sensor casing is IP68, water and dustproof. With the Edge AI, it is feasible to process locally any vibration that proceeds from the machine. The data transmitted is optimized and secure, securing BoB Assistant’s autonomy for numerous years!

It is very easy to install and does not require any configuration. Merely put BoB Assistant on the machine and start it, and in the following hours, BoB will learn how the machine works and take care of it!","700","Watteco"
"6","Zenner - CO2","ZennerImage","The ZENNER CO2 INDICATOR is a compact indoor LoRaWAN® radio sensor (868MHz) for measuring the CO2 content of indoor air. This product uses the photoacoustic principle to detect the CO2 concentration (ppm) in real time, enabling more efficient ventilation behaviour and faster response time. With the integrated display and the colour-changing LED display, the sensor always provides real-time information about the current CO2 value, the battery level and the status of the LoRaWAN® connection. An optimal stationary and mobile companion in the company, at the workplace, in the meeting room at a meeting or in the canteen. It can be placed on any flat surface. In addition, the device can also be used ""stand alone"", i.e. without a LoRaWAN® connection, e.g. at a meeting outside the company, when visiting a customer or a restaurant outside the range of the LoRaWAN® network. Without LoRaWAN® connection, however, no remote monitoring or alarming can take place. The CO2 limits can be set individually by radio command (downlink). The device can be operated with the integrated rechargeable battery or permanently powered by a standard USB-A power supply unit 5V. Please note that only the USB-A to USB-C charging cable is included, a power supply unit is also required.","270","Zenner"
"7","Milesight WS202 PIR","MilesightImage","Milesight WS202 is a LoRaWAN® PIR sensor based on passive infrared technology to detect a motion or occupancy. WS202 can detect whether there is movement within the range of 6-8 m and send the changes via LoRaWAN® network. Besides, WS202 equips with light sensor which can link PIR detection results to trigger scenes. With compact size and powered battery, WS202 is easy to install everywhere. Compliant with Milesight LoRaWAN® gateway and Milesight IoT Cloud solution, users can know the alarms or occupancy of rooms and trigger other sensors or appliances easily via webpage or mobile App remotely.

WS202 can be widely used in smart homes, smart offices, schools, warehouses, etc.","220","Milesight"
"8","Decentlab GmbH Indoor","DecentlabImage","Barometric pressure and temperature data are used by the CO2 sensor to compensate for temperature
and pressure variations and the elevation above sea level.

In addition, the device periodically performs an automatic calibration routine for the CO2 sensor. The
calibration routine requires no interaction by the user. The calibration period is set to 8 days by default.
Every 8 days, the device evaluates all sensor data of the last 8 days and performs a recalibration. The
recalibration is based on the assumption that the sensor has been exposed to fresh air (which is
assumed to contain 400 ppm CO2) for at least a few minutes during this period. If the device is operated
indoors, it is enough to ventilate the room with fresh air once in a while.","345","Decentlab"
