This product uses the photoacoustic principle to detect the CO2 concentration (ppm) in real time, enabling more efficient ventilation behaviour and faster response time. With the integrated display and the colour-changing LED display, the sensor always provides real-time information about the current CO2 value, the battery level and the status of the LoRaWAN\u00ae connection. An optimal stationary and mobile companion in the company, at the workplace, in the meeting room at a meeting or in the canteen. It can be placed on any flat surface. In addition, the device can also be used \"stand alone\", i.e. without a LoRaWAN\u00ae connection, e.g. at a meeting outside the company, when visiting a customer or a restaurant outside the range of the LoRaWAN\u00ae network. Without LoRaWAN\u00ae connection, however, no remote monitoring or alarming can take place. The CO2 limits can be set individually by radio command (downlink). The device can be operated with the integrated rechargeable battery or permanently powered by a standard USB-A power supply unit 5V.
